Q. Difference between MPA and SPA?
Ans: A Multi-Page Application renders different page content based on url change. The client (i.e. the browser) requests that page from the server and after processing the request, the server send back the response in the form of a html file which is then displayed by the browser.
In case of SPA, the client also makes a request to the server based on domain, the server instead of processing and sending the response in the form of html file, returns the entire react app, which is then processed on the client side to display the specific content. Meanwhile, this doesn't mean that the client can't make any further request to the server, it can but now for some kind of data that needs to be consumed into the react app, like json data and so on. In case of SPAs, the content is changed in the same page, we are not reloading the entire document.


BrowserRouter is the context Provider and in order to provide the routing functionalities we need to wrap the entire app in browser router. It provides the context to all of its child components.
Routes is the first child that goes inside BrowserRouter where we define Route components which in-tuen defines the content to be displayed on url change.

We often get fed up by changing the url manually(also refreshes the page each time) so here comes the Link component which acts like an anchor tag, clicking on which changes the page URL. It doesn't refreshes the page, so no state will be lost.
Link component will render the anchor tag in the DOM so use it carefully while applying css.
